2. **Search for Your Name**

   - Enter your desired name in the search bar
   - The system will show if the name is available for registration

3. **Register the Name**

   - If the name is available, click the "Register" button
   - Set the registration duration (between 1 and 5 years)
   - Review the registration fee
   - Confirm the transaction in your wallet

4. **Verify Registration**
   - Once the transaction is complete, your name will appear in your profile
   - You can view your registered names in the "My Names" section

## Registration Rules

- Names must be between 1 and 32 characters long
- Only lowercase letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens (-) are allowed
