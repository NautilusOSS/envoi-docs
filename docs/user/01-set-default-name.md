# Set Default Name

Registering a name on the enVoi Naming Service allows you to claim a unique identifier that can be used across the Voi Network. Here's how to register your own name using the web interface:

## Prerequisites

- A web browser
- An enVoi supported wallet or browser extension (like Kibisis, Lute, Biatec)
- A registered name
- Some VOI tokens to pay for the transaction

## Setting a Default Name

After registering one or more names, you can set one as your default name. The default name will be:

- Your primary identifier on the Voi Network
- Used automatically in supported applications
- Displayed first in your profile

### How to Set a Default Name

1. **Access the Web Interface**

   - Visit [app.envoi.sh](https://app.envoi.sh/)
   - Connect your wallet using the "Connect Wallet" button

2. **Click wallet button to open wallet menu**

   - Click the edit (✏️) icon next to the name

3. **Choose Your Default**

   - Find the name you want to set as default
   - Select "Set Name" from the options
   - Confirm your choice

4. **Sign transaction in wallet**

5. **Verify Default Name**
   - The change takes effect immediately

### Important Notes

- You can only have one default name at a time
- Changing your default name is free and can be done at any time
- If you transfer your default name, it will no longer be your default
